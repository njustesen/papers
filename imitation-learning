## Recall Traces: Backtracking Models for Efficient Reinforcement Learning, Goyal1 et al. (2019)
"We advocate for the use of a backtracking model that predicts the preceding states that terminate at a given high-reward state. We can train a model which, starting from a high value state
(or one that is estimated to have high value), predicts and samples which (state, action)-tuples may have led to that high value state. These traces of (state, action)
pairs, which we refer to as Recall Traces, sampled from this backtracking model starting from a high value state, are informative as they terminate in good states,
and hence we can use these traces to improve a policy".

## Self-Imitation Learning, Oh et al. (2018)
"To study how exploiting past good experiences affects learning, we propose a Self-Imitation Learning (SIL) algorithm which
learns to imitate the agent’s own past good decisions. In brief, the SIL algorithm stores experiences in a replay buffer,
learns to imitate state-action pairs in the replay buffer only when the return in the past episode is greater than the agent’s
value estimate. "
