## MCTS

### Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model
Schrittwieser et al. (2019)

We present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function.
